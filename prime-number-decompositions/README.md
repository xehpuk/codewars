# Prime number decompositions
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/prime-number-decompositions)

You have to code a function **getAllPrimeFactors** wich take an integer as parameter and return an array containing its prime decomposition by ascending factors, if a factors appears multiple time in the decomposition it should appear as many time in the array. 

exemple: `getAllPrimeFactors(100)` returns `[2,2,5,5]` in this order. 

This decomposition may not be the most practical. 

You should also write **getUniquePrimeFactorsWithCount**, a function which will return an array containing two arrays: one with prime numbers appearing in the decomposition and the other containing their respective power. 

exemple: `getUniquePrimeFactorsWithCount(100)` returns `[[2,5],[2,2]]`

You should also write **getUniquePrimeFactorsWithProducts** an array containing the prime factors to their respective powers. 

exemple: `getUniquePrimeFactorsWithProducts(100)` returns `[4,25]`

Errors, if:

* `n` is not a number
* `n` not an integer 
* `n` is negative or 0 

The three functions should respectively return `[]`,  `[[],[]]` and `[]`. 

Edge cases: 

* if `n=0`, the function should respectively return `[]`, `[[],[]]` and  `[]`.
* if `n=1`, the function should respectively return `[1]`, `[[1],[1]]`, `[1]`.
* if `n=2`, the function should respectively return `[2]`, `[[2],[1]]`, `[2]`.

The result for `n=2` is normal. The result for `n=1` is arbitrary and has been chosen to return a usefull result. The result for `n=0` is also arbitrary 
but can not be chosen to be both usefull and intuitive. (`[[0],[0]]` would be meaningfull but wont work for general use of decomposition, `[[0],[1]]` would work but is not intuitive.)
