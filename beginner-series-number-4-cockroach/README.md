# Beginner Series #4 Cockroach
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/beginner-series-number-4-cockroach)

The cockroach is one of the fastest insects. Write a function which takes its speed in km per hour and returns it in cm per second, rounded down to the integer (= floored).

For example:

```csharp
CockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```python
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```
```javascript
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```ruby
cockroach_speed(1.08) == 30
```
```coffeescript
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```
```haskell
cockroachSpeed 1.08 == 30
```
```java
cockroachSpeed(1.08) == 30
```

Note! The input is a Real number (actual type is language dependent) and is >= 0. The result should be an Integer.
