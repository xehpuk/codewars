# Return the Missing Element
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/return-the-missing-element)

Fellow code warrior, we need your help! We seem to have lost one of our array elements, and we need your help to retrieve it! Our array, `superImportantArray`, was supposed to contain all of the integers from 0 to 9 (in no particular order), but one of them seems to be missing.

Write a function called `getMissingElement` that accepts an array of unique integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive), and returns the missing element. 

### Examples:
```javascript
getMissingElement( [0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4] ) // returns 8
getMissingElement( [9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1] ) // returns 3
```
```haskell
getMissingElement [0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4] == 8
getMissingElement [9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1] == 3
```

```csharp
Kata.GetMissingElement( [0, 5, 1, 3, 2, 9, 7, 6, 4] ); // returns 8
Kata.GetMissingElement( [9, 2, 4, 5, 7, 0, 8, 6, 1] ); // returns 3
```
