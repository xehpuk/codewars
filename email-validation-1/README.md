[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/email-validation-1)

Write a function to test whether a given input is a valid email address.

For the purposes of this kata, here is what makes a valid email:


* At least one letter character at the beginning
* All characters between the first character and the @ (if any) must be letters, numbers, or underscores
* There must be an @ character (after the points listed just now)
* After the @ character, there must be at least one word character (letter, number, or underscore) or hyphen
* The email must end with *at least* one set of a dot followed by one or more word characters.
* The input must NOT be case-sensitive


The function should return `true` or `false`.
