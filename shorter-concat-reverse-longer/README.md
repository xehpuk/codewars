# shorter concat [reverse longer]
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/shorter-concat-reverse-longer)

Given 2 strings, `a` and `b`, return a string of the form: `shorter+reverse(longer)+shorter.`


In other words, the shortest string has to be put as prefix and as suffix of the reverse of the longest.

Strings `a` and `b` may be empty, but not null (In C# strings may also be null. Treat them as if they are empty.).  
If `a` and `b` have the same length treat `a` as the longer producing `b+reverse(a)+b`
