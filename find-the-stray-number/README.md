# Find the stray number
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/find-the-stray-number)

You are given an *odd-length* array of integers, in which all of them are the same, except for one single number.

Complete the method which accepts such an array, and returns that single different number.

**The input array will always be valid!** (odd-length >= 3)

## Examples

```py
[1, 1, 2] ==> 2
[17, 17, 3, 17, 17, 17, 17] ==> 3
```
```c
stray(3, {1, 1, 2}) == 2
stray(7, {17, 17, 3, 17, 17, 17, 17}) == 3
```
