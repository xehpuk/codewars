# Wise drunk man
[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/wise-drunk-man)

Fortunately last weekend, I met an utterly drunk old man. He was too drunk to be aggressive towards me. He was letting everything what he held out, from both his mind and his stomach. Although i was a bit uncomfortable, the old man's broken wisdom words caught my attention. But his talk was not continuous as it was frequently interrupted by an involuntary contractions ``` 'puke' and 'hiccup'``` . Now i am hiring you to clean up his ``` 'puke' ``` and ```'hiccup' ``` and tell me the old man's wisdom words. <br> Because drunk man also needs to take a pause and take a deep breath, you have to remove those pauses (redundant/unnecessary spaces).
