[*View on Codewars*](https://www.codewars.com/kata/delta-bits)

Write a function convertBits to determine the number of bits required to convert positive integer A to positive integer B.

For example, you can change 31 to 14 by flipping the 4th and 0th bit:
```
 31  0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1
 14  0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0
---  ---------------
bit  7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
```
Thus ```31``` and ```14``` should return ```2```.
